This directory is aimed at documenting different sources, required materials, networking structure etc. all relating to LoRa on the hardware side of this project.

## Research

The code can not really be tested without hardware and there are a lack of LoRa simulators (no SPICE).

One thing that I noticed during research is that there is a lack of easily accessable documentation for the DollaTek brand. I have not been able to find any documentation today.
