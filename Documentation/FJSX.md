Database structure
We don’t yet know how it will be built, so we are focusing on the API today until we can more confidently plan the database and its structure.

2.  11/4-25

Agenda for the day
!!NOTE!! DOCUMENTATION IS AN IMPORTANT AND ONGOING TASK !!NOTE!!

    Talk about TS VS JS

    TS is great for typing data

    TS it is!!

    Introduce more middleware (Winston, Morgan, etc.)?

    Simple CRUD Operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

    Manipulate mocked JSON data

The day starts with

    Simple CRUD for user/tips with JS, then converting all files to TypeScript and figuring it out

    JSON data to be manipulated during CRUD

    NOTE!! DOCUMENTATION

    Functional middleware

What has been accomplished

    CRUD operations for the userTips endpoint are finished using mock data to simulate a database

    We have used JSON data to simulate data being passed

    TypeScript has been initiated in the project with a tsconfig.json file

    Middleware has been added !!NOTE ONLY AS ROUTING MIDDLEWARE

3. 17/4-25

What has been accomplished

    Started working on swagger documentation, but its doesnt seem to work, we get the error message: No operations

4. 18/4-25

What has been accomplished

    Worked on CRUD-operations for the admin routes, finished almost all of them, will continue on monday

5. 21/4-25

What has been accomplished

    finished the CRUD-operations in their current form They are in need of revisiting when the database is in place

    Started working on collective ts typing (instead of having 4231435 different type interfaces), but we have no clue how to do i proparly yet

    Swagger have we worked with a bit, but it is not cooperating. Considering just starting with yaml right away instead

6. 23/4-25

What has been accomplished

    Got swagger to work with a yaml-file. There is now swagger documentation for each CRUD-operatio on each endpoint.

    For the Frontend team to use it. They need to run the server and visit http://localhost:5000/api-docs/#/
    And a "Typical" API documentation will be seen. and therefore guide them.
    furthest down on that page there is also "types" typed up for the data that is being sent and recieved. So they now how the data is structured.
    It needs a code-review before merging to develop. The code review shall dony by next meeting(25/4-25)
